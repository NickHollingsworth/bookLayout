Now i am ready to have a preprocessor that takes a [[page]] directive in a markdown file and creates a new markdown file with the section relevant start and end html added to it. 

Ppppplease

strip out all constants from build.py into a constants file that build py uses

strip out args and watcher functions?

make a preprocessor that initially just copies md fom src to tmp/step-1-enhanced-md


make a clean arg that empties step 1 and step 2 directories

seperate out tools/build/ python files so we have small components not a big monolith

only rebuild the ones that have changed, either from the wath trigger or by inspecting timestamps


preproces [[page]]

add tests for overflow or whatever

add grid
