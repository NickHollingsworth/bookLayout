look at googles explanation of the 6 parts involved in the debug and overlay
merge them into the generator adding an arg that says if they are required.
document the process from the users pov carefully

overlay the page over an exactly sized image from the pdf to see the diffs!

seperate the tools area and move the scripts etc in the top directory to have cclearer directories for 
utils i use while working (like my pdf cut import thing and my vim helpers
stuff used at runtime by the renderer
stuff used by the browers like the html to layout the results.
ask ai for a clearer structure

give me a document on how to use this. It should cover:
. how to create a source markdown document, run the builder, start a server to see the results, run in watch mode and the various arguments to the build
. how to use builtin directive.
. how to define directives in conf and use them icluding using snippets
. how to add css styling directly into the document or directives
. how to setup the project and its directory structure


[[FOOTNOTE]]jhsxj[[END FOOTNOTE]]
[[FOOTNOTE, kuhwekjhxe]]

this is true for any directive with an END
iperhaps there is a secret arg called ${body}

[[NPC, HP=17, AC=12, etc]]

if have unrecognised arg thats an error.
if i dont have a place to write an arg that might be an error or warning?

verify switch to report al errors

start documentation. perhaps its also useful as a prompt?

activate github ai advisor

will want to do inserts into a doc where another doc or snippet is named or where i name a section in another doc to insert here - i am thinking for monster stats as these get copied.

preprocess directives with
quotes tripple or somthing so replacement text can be more than one line.
arguments positional
named arguments so can provide some args in any order, will need defaulsterror if they dont have one
files must work where the replacement is in a file

get the chat to give a prompt for the next chat that covers
objective
preferences
testability
readability
ask how i give it code
summarise what we discussed about the grid
checkin with other cats

make a clean arg that empties step 1 and step 2 directories

seperate out tools/build/ python files so we have small components not a big monolith

only rebuild the ones that have changed, either from the wath trigger or by inspecting timestamps


preproces [[page]]

[[page empty]] if page is empty and does not say ots empty arn????

[[page num=1]]

add tests for overflow or whatever

add grid
