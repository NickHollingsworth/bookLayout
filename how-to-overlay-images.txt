To overlay a web page over an image when trying to recreate the image as a page.

1. get an image of the page
---------------------------

If recreating a pdf as a web page get an image of the required page with:

     pdfToImage.sh -p <page number> -r screen input.pdf output.png

note: this script is hardcoded to make pngs


2. set your css to overlay the image
------------------------------------

add this to the end of your css to cause the image to overlay the .page div
(it has its opacity set so you can see through the image to the page)

/* THE OVERLAY TOGGLE */
.page.debug::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 148mm;
    height: 210mm;
    
    /* Point to your generated PNG */
    background-image: url('page-image.png');
    background-size: contain;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    
    /* 0.5 makes it a ghost image; 0.0 hides it */
    opacity: 0.5; 
    
    /* Ensure it sits on top of your text */
    z-index: 9999;
    
    /* Prevent the image from blocking text selection while debugging */
    pointer-events: none;
}

3. Use it
---------

cp your-image.png page-image.png in the same directory as the html

To overlay the image over a page
  Add the debug class to your HTML: <div class="page odd debug">.
To tint or not tint the image to make comparison easier
  make it <div class="page odd debug no-tint"> 
 choose from no-tint, red-tint, blue-tint or green-tint

toggle the image on and off by pressing d
